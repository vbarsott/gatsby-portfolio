Gatsby plugins: (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes)
- Source-filesystem: to enable the use of files and add them to graphql layer (make queries)
  - Install: npm install gatsby-source-filesystem
  - Configure it on gatsby-config.js (make sure to restart the server after changing config)

If we have error because of images:
- kill the server, delete .cache and public folders, restart server

Featured images:
- Include the metadatas (thumb and featuredImg) on .md files
- Create folders featured and thumbs (inside images folder)
- Generate the query with graphql

For markdowns:

For styling:
- vanilla css (global.css, home.module.css, project-details.module.css, projects.module.css)

For deploying with Netlify:

All files will be generated inside public folder
- Go to Netlify and create a new site
- Drag and drop public folder inside Netlify
- Click on the url to deploy (https://vanessareactgatsbyportfolio.netlify.app)

Continuous deployment (with GitHub)
- Create a repository on GitHub
- Copy:
git remote add origin "githuburl"
git branch -M main
- Paste on the directory
- git add .
- git commit ...
- git push origin main

Connect with Netlify:
- Find the site on Netlify and deploy

To make changes and push:
- Create a new branch: git checkout -b "name"
- git add .

- Make a pull request to merge into the main branch
As this is linked to github, it will build automatically on Netlify and publish
